# Simon-Game
In this project I have created a game modelled after the traditional Simon Game.
##Description
*This is a memory game.
*At each new level a new button is added.
*To pass this level you have to correctly remember the buttons pressed in the previous levels.
*Press the buttons in order and then press the new button. Voila! You progress to the new level.
*Press one button wrong and that is game over for you!
