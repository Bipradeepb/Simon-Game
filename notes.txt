
first when keypress is encountered if game has not started it will start the game using startGame() function
if game has not started nothing will happen

startGame() function -> actually generates the next button that should be pressed next in the sequence
displays all the buttons that should be displayed in the current sequence

then document will wait for click in button in the document
the click is stored 
if the click is incorrect to the required level then startover()
otherwise continue storing the clicks 
if the userclick.length equals the generated game sequence then I can go over to the next level


Set time out function does not work with for loop
